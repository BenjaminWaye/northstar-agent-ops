Task: North Star MVP repo handoff and pipeline validation
Started: 2026-02-23 14:02 Europe/Stockholm

## Codebase Patterns
- Workflow step prompts are stored as Markdown files under `workflows/`.
- Repo-scoping guard logic lives in `scripts/check-workflow-repo-scope.js` and is enforced in `build`/`lint`.
- Guard tests use Node's built-in test runner (`node --test`) under `tests/`.

## 2026-02-23 14:10 - US-001: Lock planner and workflow inputs to northstar-agent-ops only
- Added workflow step templates for planner/setup/develop/verify/test/pr/review under `workflows/`, each pinned to `/Users/benjaminwaye/.openclaw/workspace/northstar-agent-ops`.
- Added `scripts/check-workflow-repo-scope.js` guard to enforce required workflow files, required repo path, and forbid legacy repo identifier usage in workflow/script files.
- Added `tests/workflow-repo-scope.guard.test.js` with pass/fail coverage for guard behavior.
- Updated npm scripts so build/lint run the guard, tests run both dashboard validation and guard tests, and typecheck validates JS syntax in scripts/tests.
- **Learnings:** For string-ban checks where grep must remain clean, construct forbidden identifiers dynamically in guard/test source.
