# Progress Log
Run: 1ce8f2b4-b67f-4b52-b9d9-a002b7dc4904
Task: Create PR for North-Star Multi-Agent Ops MVP plan + starter implementation
Started: 2026-02-23 13:58 Europe/Stockholm

## Codebase Patterns
- Repository is documentation-first with lightweight Node scripts for validation (`scripts/build-check.js`, `scripts/validate-dashboard-data.js`).
- Dashboard sample data lives in `data/dashboard-sample.json` and is validated via `npm test`.
- Architecture and operating model docs are under `docs/` and intended for immediate implementation handoff.
- CRM data flows from `data/crm-leads.json` and is embedded into the dashboard via `scripts/update-crm-dashboard.js` (`npm run crm:sync`).

## 2026-02-23 14:00 - pr-finalization: Open PR for MVP package
- Verified branch/worktree state and that acceptance artifacts exist across docs, data schema, and scripts.
- Added this progress log for workflow traceability.
- Ran build/lint and test scripts before PR creation.
- **Learnings:** Keep MVP coordination artifacts in docs + sample data so agents can start without runtime dependencies.

## 2026-02-27 09:15 - crm-module: Add CallMyCall CRM module
- Added `data/crm-leads.json` with 10 Swedish-market leads plus CLI scripts to sync (`scripts/update-crm-dashboard.js`) and edit (`scripts/crm-update-lead.js`).
- Extended dashboard sample + validation scripts, npm scripts, and README/docs to describe the CRM board, pipeline, and update flow.
- Ran `npm run build`, `npm test`, and `npm run crm:sync` to ensure the new CRM data passes validation.
- **Learnings:** The dashboard JSON can embed entire feature modules as long as validation scripts enforce schema parity with their source data.
